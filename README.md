ORGASM: Organized Assembly
=========

ORGASM (a.k.a. orgasm) is a very human-oriented assembly language inspired by LLVM IR and [TAL (Typed Assembly Language)](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/).

ORGASM targets to future computer/language architecture, and currently have no active/stable implementations for production usage. This repo is only a specification that describes the requirements and rules of ORGASM, and some implementation guide.

ORGASM have few optional features provided as add-on of the language, which requires machine-level implementation to support, and makes the machine feature-rich for high-level application development.

Currently it is still under design, please go to issues page if you have any questions.
